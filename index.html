                    <p> The boids lab earlier this semester inspired us to understand other natural phenomena, so naturally we began to research different physics theorems. Due to the nature of the boids lab we realized we could create an ideal gas law simulation that followed kinetic molecular theory. In order to verify the simulation was working as physics would expect, we implemented a representation of Boyle’s law and displayed the kinetic energy average of the particles.

Below are segments of the code that we found useful when simulating our particle movement.

                        <h2>Ideal Gas Law Background</h2>
                        <section>
                            <p>Our particle model is based on the five postulates of kinetic molecular theory: (1) Gas particles move linearly unless a the particle collides with another particle or a wall (2) volume between particles is negligible because the free space between them is large (3) the particles collisions are elastic, so no kinetic energy is lost during collisions (4) there is no forces of attraction and repulsion between particles (5)  the particles’ average kinetic energy is proportional to temperature.  Thus, for a group of particles average kinetic energy should remain constant in the model which gives us that KEavg= 0.5*m*vrms^2, where vrms is the root mean square velocity and m is the mass of the particle. Furthermore, using KEavg based on temperature we could directly relate our temperature to the particles’ velocities such that vrms = sqrt(3RT/m). These postulates provide us with the ideal gas law PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is number of moles of a particle, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature.
                            </p>
                            <p>In relation to collision in our model, initially ran the program assuming the collisions would result in the particles just moving at the velocity of those reaching it, but the downfall of this method was not every collision was based on the particles’ centers of mass. Based on this relationship a collision method had to be put in place. Using this new method and increasing visual range slightly we were able to create a more accurate collision model for the particles that kept our initial particle velocities consistent to what we expected.</p>
                            <p>Another component of ideal gas law we implemented in our simulation was Boyle’s law. According to Boyle’s law pressure and volume are inversely related and thus P is proportional to 1/V. In order to make sure that our program was acting in this manner we assumed temperature would be a constant that the user could change from Putty. Through the implementation of calculating Boyle’s law at different temperatures, we had a theoretical check for our simulation’s pressure vs. volume relationship.</p>
                            <p>An unexpected outcome of changing the temperature in this manner provided us with different isothermal graphs as derived in thermodynamics. Since the temperature was constant, change in temperature was zero and pressure vs. volume graph acted as one would expect isothermal graphs to act at different temperatures. In isothermal graphs as the temperature is increased energy within the system is increased, such a phenomenon was seen in our simulation as temperature was increased it had a direct impact on the kinetic energy average in our model.</p>

                        <p>Our main objective was to adapt the boids code such that the particles collided like gas particles. From there we adapted the code so the user could input different amounts for the volume and see the different results of pressure (hitting rate per second) versus time. After getting a working model of the constant volume, we modified it by integrating a synthesized beep. When the beep was working correctly, we adjusted the code to beep every time a particle hit the wall of its volume. Once we had developed a constant volume, we made a simulation to develop pressure versus volume graphs at varying temperatures (chosen by the user).  To verify that our pressure versus volume graph was behaving as expected, we plotted Boyle’s law. Finally, we added constant pressure graph so the user could see how kinetic energy would need to decrease if volume decreased at a constant pressure for varying temperatures. To verify that this was working correctly we found what the pressure should be based on the chosen temperature and plotted the result.</p>

Therefore, our main hardware components consisted of the RP2040, the DAC, and the VGA Plug (See the appendix c for a labeled circuit image.). Using what we had learned from Lab 1 on the Birdsong Synthesis we utilized the DAC to output signals through our audio socket and speaker. Initially we intended to use an HDMI port to display the simulation, but due to our focus on making our simulation as accurate as we could we decided to work significantly more on coding the simulation.

                        <p>Our particle’s movement, generated digital direct synthesis beeping, and putty interface had to be split between two cores to ensure the simulated movement did not noticeably lag. Due to the amount of things working on the cores we were limited by the number of particles that we could utilize. This led to the early testing and accuracy checks we used in the simulation below.

                        <p>One of our greatest challenges during this project was learning how collision worked for the particles and determining the best way to implement this collision. At the beginning of our test, when we created our simulation of constant volume, we had not set up our collision algorithm. This resulted in an interesting wave-like side effect when the volume was restored to the initial size; the waves would travel towards the wall at the same right from left to right and would not adjust to the increased volume (Fig. 3). The wavefront would collide with the wall and would continue this movement for every volume.

                    <section>
                        <p>From here we tried different collision methods until we had developed a collision model that worked as expected. The first method we tried was a collision method based on bi-particle collisions. Before evaluating this new collision method, we increased the size of the particle. Unexpectedly a vibrating behavior began to occur. This behavior led to the particles clustering into the corners of the simulation’s boundaries and leaving the boundary (Fig.4).

                        <p>Due to the issues we were encountering with collisions, we moved to make our pressure vs. volume graph and after developing that graph moved back to the collision. By having the pressure vs. volume graph taking in data from our simulation we were able to see a data representation and we were able to see the wavefront issue graphically. This graphic allowed us to develop a different collision algorithm and then implemented a small visual range to ensure collisions (like in the boids lab) which allowed the simulation to return to the expected ideal gas behavior.</p>

                        <p>In this lab one way to measure accuracy was on our pressure vs. volume simulation. For each temperature that pressure and volume were plotted we also had a line printed for Boyle’s law. When the pressure was equivalent at a specific volume the simulation line would overlap with the line plotted for Boyle’s law. It is important to note that because we scaled the y axis to fit most points, our y axis was scaled differently than our volume axis. In turn we determined the best coefficient n that would best fit the plot (Fig. 5). After making this change, we had to slightly shift the Boyle’s law equation based on the temperature we had entered. Once this change was made the plots aligned more closely (Fig. 6).

                        <p>We also measured the simulation’s accuracy while we maintained a constant pressure. Unlike our pressure vs. volume graph, the energy of the particles decreased in speed such that pressure was constant. Using this method, we plotted our simulation on a pressure vs. volume graph while simultaneously plotting the expected pressure. When graphing this we initially encountered a similar scaling concern (Fig. 7), but after working with coefficients we were able to find a more accurate linear pressure for our baseline.</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>Overall, we accomplished most things we wanted to in our model. We wanted to create a physics simulation that allowed for user input and utilized a display. In our original design we had intended to add an HDMI component, but as we began to work more in depth with the different graphs and user inputs, we ultimately used VGA as it allowed us to focus more on relationships like constant pressure and constant volume.</p>
                        <p>In the future it would be helpful to improve the number of particles that could be present in the simulation. Earlier in this project we attempted to implement the Alpha Max Beta Minimum Algorithm, but this resulted in an inaccurate Boyle's law curve. By utilizing things like a spinlock on certain commands, we could avoid using Protothread yield, potentially impacting the frame rate per second of the system. From here we could use the frame rate per second like we did in the boids lab to ensure that the particles were being animated during the proper time.
                        </p>   
                        <p>Another improvement that could be made is changing the y axis scaling to a log scale, from here we could compare linear plots of pressure vs. volume with a slope of -1. In this case it may be easier to determine the accuracy of the pressure vs. volume graph.

                            Due to this interest in aiding student conceptual understanding we wanted to make our simulation accessible to a wider range of people. 
                            The first adjustment we made was based on red-green colorblindness. 
                            In order for the simulation to be more easily viewed, we avoided using red and green outside of a small number of particles within the simulation and plotted our graphs utilizing blue, yellow, and magenta. Another component added to our simulation was a beeping sound that occurred when particles hit the boundary of the simulation volume. 
                            The ability to hear the changes in pressure based on volume makes the simulation more accessible to those with visual impairments. </p>

                    <section>
                        <p>There were no major safety concerns in this lab, as the user was interacting only with the computer and the monitor.
                            Although if a younger child, ages 6 to 10, is running the simulation, they should not use the simulation for more than 1.5 hours as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and World Health Organization.
